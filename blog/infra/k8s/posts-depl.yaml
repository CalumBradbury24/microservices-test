# Useful kubernetes commands
# kubectl get deployments - list running deployments
# kubectl describe deployment [deployment_name] - Print out some information about the running deployment
# kubectl apply -f posts-depl.yaml - Build deployment
# kubectl delete deployment posts-depl.yaml - Delete a deployment
# kubectl rollout restart deployment posts-depl - Restart deployment after changes that results in docker image change

# When updating code
# - Make change to project code
# - Rebuild docker image with new verion number (0.0.2 etc)
# - Update image version in this file (unless using latest)
# - Rebuild this file

--- # Allows creating multiple objects in a .yml file (in this case we add the posts service to this depl file thereby deprecating the individual posts-srv file)

# Useful kubernetes commands
# kubectl get services - list running services
# kubectl apply -f posts-srv.yaml - Build service
# kubectl delete service posts-srv.yaml - Delete a service
# kubectl rollout restart service posts-srv - Restart service after changes that results in docker image change
# kubectl describe service posts-clusterip-srv - Print out info about the service including its NodePort etc (NodePort: posts  30930/TCP property indicates the port we will access this service from in the browser (e.g localhost:30930/posts))

# nodePort - Makes the service visible outside the Kubernetes cluster by the node’s IP address and the port number declared in this property. The service also has to be of type NodePort (if this field isn’t specified, Kubernetes will allocate a node port automatically).
# port - Expose the service on the specified port internally within the cluster. That is, the service becomes visible on this port, and will send requests made to this port to the pods selected by the service.
