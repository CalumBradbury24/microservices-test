# kubernetes pod config for posts
# Docker is about running individual containers, kubernetes is about running a bunch of docker containers together
# We dont typically create individual pod config files like this
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod # The type of object we want to create
metadata: # config options for this pod
  name: posts # Name of pod
spec: # The exact attributes we want to apply to the object we are creating
  containers:
    - name: posts # Generate a container in the pod with a name of 'posts'
      image: calumbradbury/posts:0.0.1 # The exact image we want to use


# Common kubernetes commands
# kubectl get pods  - list running pods
# kubectl apply -f posts.yaml - Run in k8s/.yaml file's directory to tell kubernetes to use this config file
